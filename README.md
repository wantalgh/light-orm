Light-ORM, A Lightweight and Easy-to-Use ORM Framework
***

Light-ORM is an ORM tool based on .NET Standard 2.0, characterized by its convenice and ease of use, allowing develpers to access SQL databases with minimal coding effort, thereby significantly improving work efficiency and reducing software development costs.
To make Light-ORM simple and easy to use, the tool adopts a lightweight design with the following advantages:
- The tool's API is concise and easy to call. A single line of code can perform a data access operation, such as querying rows that meet certain conditions from the database and mapping the retrieved data into an list of .NET objects.
- The tool has a low learning curve. Due to its lightweight nature, using this tool dose not require a heavy learning cost. You only need to understand the use of the LightDataClient.DataClient class to complete operations such as adding, deleting, querying, and updating the database.
- The tools is hightly applicable. It only requires ordinary POCO to map data from the database, supports connecting to various SQL database products using different SQL dialects, and does not introduce any thoer configuraiton files or annotations into thd project, thus not effecting the project structure.
- The tool has simple dependencies. It only depends on .NET Standard 2.0, so it can be easily introduced into other projects without bringing a heavier reference burden or conflicting with other libraries in the project.
- The tool is easy to understand and extend. Because of its lightweight nature, the tool itself consists of only a few simple classes, without complex process logic and using an extensible design, users can customize their own SQL generation logic and data mapping rules as needed.
